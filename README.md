## 🌟 Features  
✅ **Soil Moisture Monitoring**: Continuously measures the **soil moisture levels** to determine when watering is needed.  
🌱 **Automatic Irrigation**: Activates the **water pump** when soil moisture falls below a certain threshold.  
💧 **Water Conservation**: Reduces water wastage by ensuring irrigation occurs only when necessary.  
📱 **Real-Time Monitoring**: Displays moisture levels and system status on an **LCD screen** for easy monitoring.

## 🧩 Components Used  
- 🌍 **Arduino Microcontroller**  
- 💧 **Soil Moisture Sensor**  
- 🚰 **Water Pump**  
- 🔌 **Relay Module**  
- 📺 **LCD Display** (I2C interface for real-time updates)  
- 🔋 **Power Supply**  
- ⚡ **Wires and Connectors**

## 💡 How It Works  
1️⃣ The **soil moisture sensor** continuously monitors the moisture content in the soil.  
2️⃣ When the moisture level drops below a predefined threshold, the **Arduino microcontroller** triggers the **relay module** to activate the **water pump**.  
3️⃣ The water pump irrigates the plants until the moisture level is restored.  
4️⃣ The **LCD display** shows real-time moisture data and irrigation status for easy monitoring and troubleshooting.
